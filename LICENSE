Most of this project is released under the MITA License (a slightly
modified version of the MIT License), which can be found in MITA.LICENSE
(or alternatively at mita.jasperhorn.nl).

The only exception is contents of the lsquaredc directory, which  are a 
modified copy of the repository found https://github.com/jwr/lsquaredc 
and are thus released under the MIT License as that version was. 
See lsquaredc/LICENSE for this license.
